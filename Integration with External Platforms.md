**Version:** 1.0

**Author:** JEJE Studios

## 1. Introduction

This document details the design and implementation of the integration between our Loom-Based Web Automation Agent and external platforms, specifically Make.com, Zapier, and GitHub. These integrations are crucial for extending the system's capabilities, automating complex workflows, and managing agent configurations.

## 2. Make.com and Zapier Integration

### 2.1. Authentication and Authorization

* **OAuth 2.0:** We will use OAuth 2.0 to allow users to connect their Make.com and Zapier accounts to our application securely.
    * This will involve:
        * Registering our application with Make.com and Zapier to obtain API keys and client secrets.
        * Implementing the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow to redirect users to Make.com/Zapier for authorization and obtain access tokens.
        * Storing the access tokens securely (e.g., encrypted in the database) for subsequent API requests.
* **User Interface for Connection:**
    * A "Connect to Make.com" and "Connect to Zapier" button will be provided in the application's settings or during the initial agent setup.
    * Clear instructions will guide users through the OAuth authorization process.

### 2.2. Identifying Integration Opportunities

* The AI will analyze the analyzed Loom video data and the user's stated goals to identify opportunities to leverage Make.com and Zapier.
* **Patterns for Identification:**
    * **Data Transfer:** If the Loom video shows users transferring data between two applications (e.g., copying data from a spreadsheet to a CRM), Make.com/Zapier are likely suitable for automating this.
    * **Trigger-Action Sequences:** If the video shows a sequence of actions where one action triggers another (e.g., a new order in Shopify triggers a shipping label creation in ShipStation), Make.com/Zapier can automate this.
    * **Repetitive Tasks:** Any repetitive task involving multiple applications is a potential candidate for automation via these platforms.
* **Contextual Analysis:**
    * The AI should consider the specific applications involved, the type of data being processed, and the overall workflow to determine the most appropriate Make.com/Zapier modules.

### 2.3. Suggesting Make.com/Zapier Modules and Scenarios/Zaps

* The system should suggest specific modules or actions within Make.com and Zapier that could be used to automate the identified tasks.
    * **Example:** If the Loom video shows a user creating a new customer in a CRM after receiving an order in Shopify, the system could suggest using the "Shopify - New Order" trigger and the "CRM - Create Customer" action in Make.com/Zapier.
* The suggestions should be presented to the user in a clear and understandable way, explaining the potential benefits of using these platforms.
* The UI should allow users to explore the suggested integrations and customize them if needed.

### 2.4. Triggering Make.com/Zapier Scenarios/Zaps

* Our application will need to trigger the appropriate scenarios or zaps in Make.com/Zapier based on the user's choices and the analyzed Loom data.
* **API Calls:** This will involve making API calls to the Make.com/Zapier API.
    * We will need to determine the specific API endpoints and data formats required to trigger scenarios/zaps.
    * The data extracted from the Loom video (e.g., order details, customer information) will need to be mapped to the input fields of the Make.com/Zapier modules.
* **Asynchronous Execution:** Make.com/Zapier scenarios/zaps often run asynchronously. Our application should handle this by:
    * Providing feedback to the user on the status of the triggered automation.
    * Implementing mechanisms to check for completion or errors.
* **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is crucial to deal with potential issues during communication with the Make.com/Zapier APIs or within the triggered scenarios/zaps.

## 3. GitHub Integration

### 3.1. OAuth 2.0 Authentication with GitHub

* We will use OAuth 2.0 to allow users to connect their GitHub accounts to our application.
    * This will involve:
        * Registering our application with GitHub to obtain a client ID and client secret.
        * Implementing the OAuth 2.0 web application flow to redirect users to GitHub for authorization and obtain access tokens.
        * Storing the access tokens securely for subsequent API requests.
* **User Interface for Connection:**
    * A "Connect to GitHub" button will be provided in the application's settings.
    * Clear instructions will guide users through the OAuth authorization process.

### 3.2. Repository Selection/Creation

* After successful authentication, the user will be presented with options to:
    * **Select an Existing Repository:** Allow the user to choose one of their existing GitHub repositories to store the agent configurations.
    * **Create a New Repository:** Provide an option to create a new repository directly from our application.
        * This will involve using the GitHub API to create a new repository with a default name (e.g., "LoomAutomationAgents") or allowing the user to specify a name.

### 3.3. Agent Configuration Export

* The agent's configuration data (chunks, learned actions, integration details) will be exported into a structured file format.
    * **Recommended Format:** JSON or YAML are suitable choices due to their readability and ease of parsing.
    * **File Structure:** The file should contain all the necessary information to recreate the agent, including:
        * Agent metadata (name, description).
        * Loom video URL.
        * Chunk definitions (timestamps, names, actions).
        * Playwright commands (if any).
        * Make.com/Zapier integration details (if any).
* The file should be named in a way that is descriptive and avoids naming conflicts (e.g., `agent_name_timestamp.json`).

### 3.4. File Committing and Pushing

* The application will use the GitHub API to:
    * **Create or update** the agent configuration file in the selected repository.
    * **Commit** the changes with a descriptive commit message (e.g., "Exported agent configuration for [Agent Name]").
    * **Push** the commit to the repository.

### 3.5. Branch Management (Future)

* In the future, we might consider implementing branch management to allow users to:
    * Create branches for experimenting with different versions of an agent.
    * Merge changes between branches.

## 4. Error Handling and Logging

* Robust error handling and logging will be implemented for all interactions with external platforms.
* This will include:
    * Logging API request details (endpoints, data, headers).
    * Logging API responses and error messages.
    * Implementing retry mechanisms for transient errors.
    * Providing informative error messages to the user.

This document provides a detailed specification for integrating our Loom-Based Web Automation Agent with Make.com, Zapier, and GitHub. These integrations are essential for leveraging existing automation capabilities, simplifying complex workflows, and managing agent configurations effectively.

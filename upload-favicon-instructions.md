# Uploading Favicon to Supabase

The 404 error in your browser console is because your Supabase instance doesn't have a favicon.ico file. Here are instructions on how to upload one:

## Option 1: Upload to Supabase Storage

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard: https://dafizawmeehypygvgdge.supabase.co
2. Go to Storage â†’ Buckets
3. Create a new public bucket called "public" if it doesn't exist
4. Upload the `supabase-assets/favicon.ico` file to the root of the bucket
5. Set the file permissions to public

## Option 2: Use a Proxy in Your App

If you don't have access to upload files to Supabase, you can use a proxy in your application to handle the favicon request:

```javascript
// In your Express server.js, add this route
app.get('/proxy-favicon', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../supabase-assets/favicon.ico'));
});
```

## Option 3: Browser Extension

You can also use a browser extension to block the favicon.ico requests:

1. Install uBlock Origin or similar content blocker
2. Add a custom rule to block requests to `https://dafizawmeehypygvgdge.supabase.co/favicon.ico`

## The Current Solution

We've already created a favicon.ico file for your client application, which will be used when accessing your app directly. However, when your browser makes API calls to Supabase, it will still try to fetch the favicon from the Supabase domain.

This 404 error doesn't affect the functionality of your application, it's just a console warning that can be ignored.

## 1. Introduction

This document details the error handling and recovery strategy for the Loom-Based Web Automation Agent. Robust error handling is crucial for ensuring the application's reliability, providing informative feedback to the user, and enabling the system to recover from unexpected situations.

## 2. Error Categories

Errors can occur in various parts of the application:

* **Loom Analysis Errors:** Errors during the processing of the Loom video and transcript.
* **Automation Errors (Playwright):** Errors during the execution of automated actions in the browser.
* **Integration Errors:** Errors when communicating with external platforms (Make.com, Zapier, GitHub).
* **Application Errors:** General errors within the application's code or infrastructure.

## 3. Loom Analysis Errors

### 3.1. Transcript Processing Errors

* **Error:** Transcript not found or inaccessible.
    * **Handling:** Inform the user that the transcript is unavailable and suggest alternative analysis methods (e.g., relying more on visual analysis or prompting for user input).
* **Error:** Transcript parsing failed.
    * **Handling:** Log the error details and potentially retry the parsing process. If repeated failures occur, prompt the user to provide a different transcript source or manually enter relevant information.
* **Error:** NLP processing failed.
    * **Handling:** Log the error and potentially simplify the NLP processing (e.g., rely on basic keyword matching instead of more advanced intent recognition).

### 3.2. URL Extraction Errors

* **Error:** OCR failed to extract URLs.
    * **Handling:** Log the error and potentially adjust OCR parameters or try a different OCR library. If persistent failures occur, warn the user about potential inaccuracies in URL tracking.
* **Error:** Invalid or malformed URL detected.
    * **Handling:** Log the error and attempt to correct the URL. If correction is not possible, skip the invalid URL and continue processing.

### 3.3. Visual Analysis Errors

* **Error:** Visual analysis failed to detect actions.
    * **Handling:** Log the error and rely more heavily on the transcript for action identification.
* **Error:** OCR failed to identify UI elements.
    * **Handling:** Log the error and potentially adjust OCR parameters or try a different OCR library.

## 4. Automation Errors (Playwright)

### 4.1. Playwright Exceptions

* Playwright methods can throw exceptions (e.g., `TimeoutError`, `ElementNotFoundError`).
* **Handling:**
    * Wrap Playwright calls in `try-catch` blocks.
    * Log the specific exception type and message.
    * Implement retry mechanisms for transient errors (e.g., network issues).
    * Provide informative error messages to the user (e.g., "Element not found," "Navigation timed out").
    * Offer the user options to "Try Again" or "Take Control."

### 4.2. Unexpected Page State

* The page might not behave as expected during automation (e.g., an error message is displayed instead of navigating to the next page).
* **Handling:**
    * Implement checks for expected page states after each action.
    * If an unexpected state is detected, log the details and provide feedback to the user.
    * Offer the user options to "Skip" or "Stop" the automation.

### 4.3. Navigation Errors

* Navigation might fail due to network issues, invalid URLs, or website errors.
* **Handling:**
    * Retry navigation a few times.
    * Log the error and inform the user.
    * Potentially suggest alternative URLs or actions.

## 5. Integration Errors

### 5.1. Make.com/Zapier API Errors

* Errors can occur when communicating with the Make.com or Zapier APIs (e.g., authentication failures, invalid requests, rate limiting).
* **Handling:**
    * Log the API request and response details.
    * Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for rate limiting errors.
    * Provide informative error messages to the user (e.g., "Failed to trigger Make.com scenario").
    * Offer the user options to retry the integration or proceed with alternative automation methods.

### 5.2. GitHub API Errors

* Errors can occur when interacting with the GitHub API (e.g., authentication failures, repository not found, file creation errors).
* **Handling:**
    * Log the API request and response details.
    * Provide informative error messages to the user (e.g., "Failed to push agent to GitHub").
    * Offer the user options to retry the action or save the agent locally.

## 6. Application Errors

### 6.1. Backend Errors

* General errors in the Node.js/Express.js backend code.
* **Handling:**
    * Use `try-catch` blocks and appropriate error handling middleware in Express.js.
    * Log detailed error information (stack traces, etc.).
    * Return user-friendly error messages to the frontend.

### 6.2. Database Errors

* Errors when interacting with the Supabase database (e.g., connection failures, query errors).
* **Handling:**
    * Implement retry mechanisms for database connection errors.
    * Log detailed error information.
    * Provide informative error messages to the user.

## 7. User Feedback and Error Reporting

* The user interface should provide clear and informative error messages.
* Screenshots and logs of the AI's attempted actions should be displayed when appropriate.
* Users should be able to provide feedback on errors and suggest corrections.
* Error logs should be structured and searchable for debugging purposes.

## 8. Recovery Mechanisms

* **Automatic Retries:** For transient errors (e.g., network issues), the system should automatically retry the failed action a few times.
* **User Intervention:** When automatic retries fail or the error requires user input, the system should pause the automation and allow the user to take control.
* **Learning and Adaptation:** The system should learn from user interventions and adjust its behavior to avoid similar errors in the future.

This document provides a comprehensive error handling and recovery strategy, covering various error categories and outlining specific handling procedures. A well-designed error handling system is crucial for the stability, reliability, and user experience of the Loom-Based Web Automation Agent.
